#Some C++ data types, their format specifiers, and their most common bit widths are as follows:

Int ("%d"): 32 Bit integer
Long ("%ld"): 64 bit integer
Char ("%c"): Character type
Float ("%f"): 32 bit real value
Double ("%lf"): 64 bit real value

*You can also use cin and cout instead of scanf and printf; however, if you are taking a million numbers as input and printing a million lines, it is faster to use scanf and printf.


#Pointer 
*var is used to makes change in value
&var show address 

#Variable sized array(can be done using pointer)

#STL	(revise it or correct it, if wrong written below)
-vector<data_type> var_name;
-list<data_type> var_name;
-map<data_type> var_name;

#Class
-freind function (learn it)
-inheritance 
-virtual function

#Inheritance for predefined classed like ostream and istream etc

#string
-stringstream header file sstream

Operator >> Extracts formatted data.
Operator << Inserts formatted data.
Method str() Gets the contents of underlying string device object.
Method str(string) Sets the contents of underlying string device object.
Its header file is sstream.

#Templates - only knows what it is (need to understand more about this)
	template <class T> // here T can be any data type like int, float, etc.
	class vector{
	
	};

#operator overloading for ostream << and istream >> (revise it for cplusplus)

ostream &operator<<(ostream &output, className &objName){
	output<< "wrinting output as we want like " << objName.using_funciton() << objName.use_variables << "this";
	return output;
}
istream &operator>>(istream &input, Person &p){
	input >> p.name >> p.age;
	return input;
}

#enum datatype (need to understand more in this )
#union 	(need to understand more in this)
# #include<iomanip> // input output manipulator I need to understand this because I dont know about this.
